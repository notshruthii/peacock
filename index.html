              Traditional Indian art has always carried stories, heritage, and
              culture across generations. Today, artisans are not only
              preserving these age-old crafts but also collaborating with big
              brands to bring authenticity, beauty, and uniqueness into global
              markets. Their skills help brands stand out, while also keeping
              traditions alive.
