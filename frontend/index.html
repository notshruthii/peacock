              Traditional Indian art has always carried stories, heritage, and
              culture across generations. Today, artisans are not only
              preserving these age-old crafts but also collaborating with big
              brands to bring authenticity, beauty, and uniqueness into global
              markets. Their skills help brands stand out, while also keeping
              traditions alive.

          <p>
            Born in a small village in Bihar, Meera Devi grew up watching her
            grandmother paint stories of gods, nature, and everyday life on mud
            walls. With every brush stroke, she carried forward a 700-year-old
            tradition. But as demand for handmade art declined, Meera almost
            gave up painting to work as a daily laborer. Joining
            <strong>कलाGhar</strong> changed her journey—today, her vibrant
            Madhubani pieces reach homes across India and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Meera, each artwork is not just paint on paper, but a living
            memory of her ancestors.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “When someone buys my art, I feel my village is alive in their
            home.” – Meera Devi
